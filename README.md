# Phobos

This is where all the source code for project Phobos will go. This project is a pretty long-term project that hopefully will finish by a month. As this is being written,
I've finished up prototyping with functioning flashlight with batteries, movement (to be optimized), small horror elements, pickupables, and many more to come.

Plans:
- Add a battery percentage display (Important)
- Add pickupable battery (Important)
- Learn how to add jumpscares
- Level design
- Puzzles


Goal for the player:
- Collect all (num of) (item) to get out of the hospital
- To not die to the clown 

Clown (Biggest Coding Challenge): 
- Patrols around the whole map while the player looks for all (item)
- Has a "field of vision" - does not go through walls but he will patrol hallways 
- There is more than one clown 
- Some Clowns will hide in rooms to jumpscare the player out of no where (wow so scary)
+ (Adding on: This will build a tolerance for players so to make up for it, lights will be off/flickering + audio)
